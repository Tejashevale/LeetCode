Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

solution:
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;

        int[] mapS = new int[256];  
        int[] mapT = new int[256]; 

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char chS = s.charAt(i);
            char chT = t.charAt(i);

           if (mapS[chS] != mapT[chT]) {
                return false;
            }
            
            mapS[chS] = i + 1;
            mapT[chT] = i + 1;
        }

        return true;
    }

    
}
